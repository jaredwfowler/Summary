About===============================================================================================
====================================================================================================
Nicholas Darvas is a well known investor who successfully made 2 million dollars in the stock market
back in the 1950's. The inspiration for this program comes from his book "How I made 2,000,000
dollars in the stock market."
A fundamental thought, that I have taken from this book, is that there really isn't a possible
pure automated way to trade in the market. The tools I will program will be for the use of finding
plausible stocks which "might" qualify for further consideration.  Considered stocks should then be
handled on a daily basis, preferably after the market is closed. The use of stop orders, stop losses,
and box theory should be used.

Excerpts and Notes from Book: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But how to start? How to find what stocks to buy? You could not pick
them out with a pin. You must have information. That was my major
problem: how to obtain it. I now realize that this is, in fact, impossible
for the ordinary man


I was buoyed up and excited by small gains, and overlooked my
losses. I completely ignored the fact that I was holding a lot of stock
which was standing well below the price I had paid for it and looked
like staying there.


I would rush to the telephone to buy the stock they recommended. It
invariably went down. I could not understand this but I was not the
slightest bit worried. They must know what they were talking about.
The next stock must go up. It seldom did.
I did not know it but I was already coming up against one of the great
pitfalls of the small operator—the almost insoluble problem of when to
enter the market. These sudden drops immediately after he has invested
his money are one of the most mystifying phenomena facing the
amateur. It took me years to realize that when these financial tipsters
advise the small operator to buy a stock, those professionals who have
bought the stock much earlier on inside information are selling.
Simultaneously with the withdrawal of the inside-track money, the
small sucker money is coming in. They are not firstest with the mostest,
but lastest with the leastest. They are far too late, and their money is
always too small to support the stock at its false high point once the
professionals are out.


I did not appreciate it at the time, but it was a
classic refutation of: "You cannot go broke taking a profit." Of course
you can.


What I did not know was that when I
came to offer them for sale, some of these stocks stuck to my fingers
like tar. I found it very difficult getting rid of them— and rarely at
anything like the price I paid for them. Why? Because there was no
rigid price discipline as there is for the listed securities; there were no
specialists—professionals to assure a continuous and orderly market;
there were no reports where one could see at what price a transaction
took place. There were only the "Bid" and "Ask" prices. These, I
discovered, were often very far apart. When I wanted to sell at 42,
which was the quoted "Ask" price, I only found a buyer at 38, the
quoted "Bid" price. I sometimes ended up at 40 but that was by no means
certain.
When I stumbled into the over-the-counter market, all this was
unknown to me. Fortunately, I quickly came to realize that this is a
specialized field and is only lucrative for experts who really know
something about the affairs of a particular company. I decided to give it
up, and returned my attention to listed securities.


Through these and other experiences, however, certain conclusions
began to emerge. As a baby repeatedly hearing the same words starts to
learn them, so did I slowly start, through my trading experiences, to
discern the outlines of some rules that I could apply?
They were:
1. I should not follow advisory services. They are not infallible,
either in Canada or on Wall Street.
2. I should be cautious with brokers' advice. They can be wrong.
3. I should ignore Wall Street sayings, no matter how ancient and
revered.
4. I should not trade "over the counter"—only in listed stocks
where there is always a buyer when I want to sell.
5. I should not listen to rumors, no matter how well founded they
may appear.
6. The fundamental approach worked better for me than gambling. I
should study it.
7. I should rather hold on to one rising stock for a longer period than
juggle with a dozen stocks for a short period at a time.


It would be difficult for anyone to conceive the shattering effects of
the blow. If I had been a wild gambler, I could have expected such a
position. But I had done my best not to be one. I had labored long and
hard. I had done everything possible to avoid a mistake. I had
researched, analyzed, compared. I had based my decision on the most
trustworthy fundamental information. And yet, the only result was that
I was wrecked to the tune of $9,000.


What, I asked myself, was the value of examining company reports,
studying the industry outlook, the ratings, the price-earnings ratios? The
stock that saved me from disaster was one about which I knew nothing.
I picked it for one reason only— it seemed to be rising.


I realized that although there
is an element of chance in every field in life, I could not base my
operations on luck. I could be lucky once, maybe twice—but not
constantly.


I was happy and excited—not so much because of the money but
simply because I had bought M & M WOOD WORKING, as I had bought
TEXAS GULF PRODUCING, purely on the basis of its action in the market.
I knew nothing about it nor could I find out very much. Yet I assumed
from its continuing rise and high volume that some people knew a lot
more about it than I did.


This experience did more than anything to convince me that the purely           // 2 Variables: Price action and Volume
technical approach to the market was sound. It meant that if I studied
price action and volume, discarding all other factors, I could get
positive results.


I now began to try to work from this point of view. I concentrated on a         // No BIG BOYS. It's no surprise to see big companies like
close study of price and volume and tried to ignore all rumors, tips or         // AAPL or NVDA have large volume spikes. Limit search down
fundamental information. I decided not to concern myself with the               // to stocks where volume is within a maximum threshold
reasons behind a rise. I figured that if some fundamental change for
the better takes place in the life of a company, this soon shows up in
the rising price and volume of its stock, because many people are
anxious to buy it. If I could train my eyes to spot this upward change in
its early stages, as in the case of M & M WOOD WORKING, I could
participate in the stock's rise without knowing the reason for it.
The problem was: How to detect this change? After much thinking I
found one criterion—that was to compare stocks with people.
This is how I began to work it out: If a tempestuous beauty were to
jump on a table and do a wild dance, no one would be particularly
astonished. That is the sort of characteristic behavior people have come to
expect from her. But if a dignified matron were suddenly to do the same,
this would be unusual and people would immediately say, "There is
something strange here— something has happened. *'
In the same way, I decided that if a usually inactive stock suddenly
became active I would consider this unusual, and if it also advanced
in price I would buy it. I would assume that somewhere behind the outof-
the-ordinary movement there was a group who had some good
information. By buying the stock I would become their silent partner.


I read books, I examined stock tables, I inspected hundreds of charts. As       // Should this be considered only at buy in point, not
I studied them I began to learn things about stock movements which I            // during potential selection process?
had not seen before. I started to realize that stock movements were
not completely haphazard. Stocks did not fly like balloons in any
direction. As if attracted by a magnet, they had a defined upward or
downward trend, which, once established, tended to continue. Within
this trend stocks moved in a series of frames, or what I began to call
"boxes".
They would oscillate fairly consistently between a low and a high
point. The area, which enclosed this up-and-down movement,
represented the box or frame. These boxes began to exist very clearly
for me.
This was the beginning of my box theory, which was to lead to a
fortune.
This is how I applied my theory: When the boxes of a stock in which
I was interested stood, like a pyramid, on top of each other, and my
stock was in the highest box, I started to watch it. It could bounce
between the top and the bottom of the box and I was perfectly
satisfied. Once I had decided on the dimensions of the box, the stock
could do what it liked, but only within that frame. In fact, if it did
not bounce up and down inside that box I was worried.
No bouncing, no movement, meant it was not a lively stock. And if it
were not a lively stock I was not interested in it because that meant it
would probably not rise dynamically.
I found that a stock sometimes stayed for weeks in one box.
I did not care how long it stayed in its box as long as it did and did
not fall below the lower frame figure.


the movement I was constantly
watching for was an upward thrust toward the next box. If this
occurred I bought the stock.
I did not find any fixed rule as to how this takes place. It just has to be
observed and instantly acted upon


What I had
to decide was the range of the box. This, of course, varied with
different stocks. For instance, some stocks moved in a very small
frame, perhaps not more than 10% each way. Other wide-swinging
stocks moved in a frame between 15% and 20%. The task was to
define the frame exactly and be sure the stock did not move decisively
below the lower edge of the box. If it did, I sold it at once, because it
was not acting right.
While it stayed within its box, I considered a reaction from 55 to 50
as quite normal. It did not mean to me that the stock was going to fall
back. Just the contrary.
Before a dancer leaps into the air he goes into a crouch to set
himself for the spring. I found it was the same with stocks. They
usually did not suddenly shoot up from 50 to 70. In other words, I
considered that a stock in upward trend that reacted to 45 after
reaching 50 was like a dancer crouching, ready for the spring-up.
Later when I had more experience I also learned that this 45 position
in a stock after a 50 high point has another important benefit. It shakes
out the weak and frightened stockholders who mistake this reaction for
a drop, and enables the stock to advance more rapidly.


The major problem still remained; what was the right time to buy into
it?


Although I was improving in my selection and method, I was
still somewhat of a baby in the mechanics of Wall Street, so I placed
my problem before the broker. We discussed the 61-point telephone
call, which had unfortunately missed me. He told me I should have
put in an automatic "on stop" buy order. This meant the stock would
have been bought when it rose to 61. He suggested that whenever I
made a decision about a stock I should put in a buy order at a named
figure. Then the stock would be bought for me without further
consultation if the market reached this figure. This I agreed to do.


But I decided against it and                                                    // THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "CANNOT" IN THE MARKET
stubbornly held on. My pride did not let me act. The prestige of my
theory was at stake. I just kept saying this stock cannot go down any
further. I did not know what I learned later, that there is no such thing
as cannot in the market. Any stock can do anything. By the end of the
next week, the profit from my three previous operations was gone. I was
back where I had started.
1. This experience, as I see it, was an important turning point of my
stock-market career.
2. It was at this point that I finally realized that
3. There is no sure thing in the market - I was bound to be wrong
half of the time.
4. I must accept this fact and readjust myself accordingly - my
pride and ego would have to be subdued.
5. I must become an impartial diagnostician, who does not identify
himself with any theory or stock.
6. I cannot merely take chances. First, I have to reduce my risks as            // I CANOOT MERELY TAKE CHANCES
far as humanly possible.
The first step I took in that direction was to adopt what I called my
quick-loss weapon. I already knew that I would be wrong half of the
time. Why not accept my mistakes realistically and sell immediately at
a small loss? If I bought a stock at 25, why not at the same time order
the stock to be sold if it returned below 24?
I decided to give "on-stop" orders to buy at a certain figure with an
automatic "stop-loss" order on them in case the stock went down.
This way, I figured, I would never sleep with a loss. If any of my
stocks went below the price I thought they should, I would not own
them when I went to bed that night. I knew that many times I would
be "stopped out" for the sake of a point just to see my stock climb up
immediately after. But I realized that this was not so important as
stopping the big losses. Besides, I could always buy back the stock—by
paying a higher price.


I decided that since I could not train myself not to get scared every
time, it was better to adopt another method. This was to hold on to a
rising stock but, at the same time, keep raising my stop-loss order
parallel with its rise. I would keep it at such a distance that a
meaningless swing in the price would not touch it off. If, however, the
stock really turned around and began to drop, I would be sold out
immediately. This way the market would never be able to get more than
a fraction of my profits away.
And how to determine when to take profits?
I realized that I would not be able to sell at the top. Anyone who
claims he can consistently do this is lying. If I sold while the stock
was rising, it would be a pure guess, because I could not know how
far an advance might carry. This would be no cleverer a guess than
anticipating that "My Fair Lady" would end its run after 200
performances. You could also guess it would go off after 300 or
400 performances. Why did it not go off at any of these figures?
Because the producer would be a fool to close the show when he sees
the theater full every night. It is only when he starts to notice empty
seats that he considers closing the show.
I carried the Broadway comparison through to the problem of selling.
I would be a fool to sell a stock as long as it keeps advancing. When to
sell then? Why, when the boxes started to go into reverse! When the
pyramids started to tumble downwards, that was the time to close the
show and sell out. My trailing stop-loss, which I moved up behind the
rising price of the stock, should take care of this automatically.


Having made these decisions, I then sat back and re-defined my
objectives in the stock market:
1. Right stocks
2. Right timing
3. Small losses
4. Big profits
I examined my weapons:
1. Price and volume
2. Box theory
3. Automatic buy-order
4. Stop-loss sell-order
As to my basic strategy, I decided I would always do this: I would
just jog along with an upward trend, trailing my stop-loss insurance
behind me. As the trend continued, I would buy more. When the
trend reversed? I would run like a thief.
I realized that there were a great many snags. There was bound to be a lot
of guesswork in the operation. My estimate that I would be right half
of the time could be optimistic. But at last I saw my problem more
clearly than ever. I knew that I had to adopt a cold, unemotional
attitude toward stocks; that I must not fall in love with them when
they rose and I must not get angry when they fell; that there are no
such animals as good or bad stocks. There are only rising and falling
stocks—and I should hold the rising ones and sell those that fall.


We also decided upon one tool—this was Barton's, a weekly financial
publication, which we arranged to have airmailed to me as soon as it
was published. This would show me any stocks, which might be
moving up.


Since I had noticed it in Barron's, I forgot about it. It
was too late for me to act. I had to wait for another opportunity.


In the beginning, I was terribly afraid. Not that being in New York
had helped me in the past, but to be able to communicate with Wall
Street by telephone had given me a false feeling of security. This I
missed for a while. It was only later, as I gradually gained experience
in trading through cables, that I came to see the advantages of it. No
phone calls, no confusion, no contradictory rumors—these factors
combined gave me a much more detached view.
As I only handled five to eight stocks at a time, I automatically separated
them from the confusing, jungle-like movement of the hundreds of
stocks, which surrounded them. I was influenced by nothing but the
price of my stocks.
I could not hear what people said, but I could see what they did. It was
like a poker game in which I could not hear the betting, but I could
see all the cards.
I did not know it at the time, but later, as I became more experienced in
the market, I realized how invaluable this was to me. Of course, the
poker players would try to mislead me with words, and they would not
show me their cards. But if I did not listen to their words, and
constantly watched their cards, I could guess what they were doing.


I finally discovered this: the inexplicable moves in my
stocks usually coincided with some violent move in the general market.
As I only received the quotes of my own stocks, I was completely
disregarding the possible influence of the general market on them. This
was no better than trying to direct a battle by only looking at one
section of the battlefield.
This was a very important discovery for me and I immediately acted on
it. I asked my broker to add to the end of my cables the closing price
of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. This I thought would give me a
clear enough picture of how the general market behaved.
As I tried to relate the Dow-Jones Industrial Average to the
movements of my own stocks, I reasoned that if the Average was
going up, so would my stocks.
Soon after, I found out that this was not true. To try to fit the market
into a rigid pattern was a mistake. It seemed quite impossible to do it.
Each stock behaved differently. There was no such thing as a mechanical
pattern.
I found that the relationship between the Average and
my individual stocks were confined within certain principles, but they
could not be measured exactly. From then on, I made up my mind to
keep watching the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, but only in order to
determine whether I was in a strong or a weak market. This I did
because I realized that a general market cycle influences almost every
stock. The main cycles like a bear or a bull market usually creep into the
majority of them.


Simultaneously, I tried to train my emotions. I worked it this way:
Whenever I bought a stock, I wrote down my reason for doing so. I did
the same when I sold it. Whenever a trade ended with a loss, I wrote
down the reason I thought caused it. Then I tried not to repeat the same
mistake. This is how one of my tables looked:
                    Brought     Sold      Cause of Error
ISLAND CREEK COAL   46          43½       Brought too late
JOY MANUFACTURING   62          60⅝       Stop-loss too close
EASTERN GAS & FUEL  27¾         25⅛       Overlooked weak general market
ALCOA               118         116½      Brought on decline
COOPER-BESSEMER     55⅜         54        Wrong timing.
These cause-of-error tables helped me immeasurably. As I drew
them up one after the other I was learning something from each trading.
I started to see that stocks have characters just like people. This is
not so illogical, because they faithfully reflect the character of the
people who buy and sell them.


I began to take the view that if these stocks slapped me
twice I would refuse to touch them any more. I would just shake off
the blow and go away to buy something I could handle better. This
does not mean, of course, that other people with a different temperament
from mine were not able to get on well with them - just as some people
get along with one set of people better than they do with others.
The experience I gained through my cause-of-error tables became one of
the most important of all my qualifications. I now realized I could
never have learned it from books. I began to see that it is like driving
a car. The driver can be taught how to use the accelerator, the steering
wheel and the brakes, but he still has to develop his own feeling for
driving. No one can tell him how to judge whether he is too close to
the car in front of him or when he should slow down. This he can
only learn through experience.
As I flew around the world and operated in Wall Street by cables, I
slowly came to see that though I was becoming a diagnostician I could
not be a prophet. When I examined a stock and found it strong, all I
could say was: It is healthy now, today, at this hour. I could not
guarantee it would not catch a cold tomorrow. My educated guesses,
no matter how cautious they were, many times turned out to be
wrong. But this did not upset me any more. After all, I thought, who
was I to say what a stock should or should not do?


I bought with bold confidence when I
thought I was right and coldly, without hurt ego, I took my limited
losses when I thought I was proven wrong.


Finally, on August 26, 1957, I found myself without a single stock.
My automatic stop-loss had sold me out of everything. In two months
every one of my stocks had slowly turned around, and one by one had
sagged through the bottom of their boxes. And one by one, even if it
was only a question of half a point, they were sold.
I did not like it, but there was nothing I could do. According to my
theory, I just had to sit back and wait patiently until one or more of the
stocks I had been stopped out of, or any other stocks I was watching,
went towards a new higher box.
Eager and anxious, I watched from the sidelines with not a dollar
invested, while prices continued to drop.
But no opportunity seemed to appear. What I did not know was that
we were at the end of one phase of the great bull market. It was
several months before this became evident and it was declared a bear
market. Half the Wall Street analysts still discuss it. They say it was
merely an intermediate reaction —a temporary halt in the rising market.
They all agree, however, that prices collapsed.
I realized that it was impossible for me to assess
great historical turning points in the market when they began to
happen. What fascinated me, as Wall Street prices continued to fall,
was the gradual realization that my system of ducking out quickly
with my stop-losses made such an assessment unnecessary.


Look at the following table:
                        1957     1958     1958
                        I sold   Lowest   Highest
                        at       price    price
BALTIMORE & OHIO        55       22⅝      45¼
DAYSTROM                42¼      30       39¾
FOSTER WHEELER          59½      25⅛      39⅛
AEROQUIP                27½      16⅞      25¾
ALLIED CONTROL          48¼      33½      46½
DRESSER INDUSTRIES      54½      33       46⅝
JOY MANUFACTURING       68       38       54½
ALLEGHENY LUDLUM        56½      30⅛      49⅜
When I looked at this table, I thought this: If my stop-losses had not
taken me out of the market I could have lost about 50% of my
investment. I would have been like a man in a cage, locked in with
my holdings and missing my opportunity to make a fortune. The
only way I could have escaped would have been by smashing out,
taking a 50% loss, possibly ruining myself, and gravely impairing my
confidence for future deals.
I could, of course, have bought these stocks and "put them away.'* This
is a classic solution among people who call themselves conservative
investors. But by now I regarded them as pure gamblers. How can they
be non-gamblers when they stay with a stock even if it continues to
drop? A non-gambler must get out when his stocks fall. They stay in
with the gambler's eternal hope of the turn of a lucky card.
I thought of the people who paid 250 for NEW YORK CENTRAL in 1929.
If they were still holding it today it was worth about 27. Yet they
would be indignant if you called them gamblers!
When I went into the accounts more closely I found I had the
unenviable distinction of coming out of the greatest bull market in
history with a lot of experience, a great amount of knowledge, much
more confidence—and a net loss of $889.


There was no doubt in my mind now that I could not make money by
buying a stock and then trying to cheer it on.


The situation reminded me of George Bernard Shaw's remark at the
opening night of one of his plays. After the curtain fell everyone
cheered and clapped except one man who booed. G.B.S. went up to him
and said: "Don't you like my play?"
The man replied, "No, I don't." Whereupon Shaw said: "Neither do I,
but what can the two of us do against all that crowd?"
So I accepted everything for what it was—not what I wanted it to be. I
just stayed on the sidelines and waited for better times to come.


The period that followed I spent like a runner limbering up for the
race. Week after week, while I did not have any stock and the market
was in a steady downtrend, I followed the quotations in Barron's. I
tried to detect those stocks that resisted the decline. I reasoned that if
they could swim against the stream, they were the ones that would
advance most rapidly when the current changed.


On closer examination, I found the majority of these were companies
whose earning trends pointed sharply upward. The conclusion was
obvious: capital was flowing into these stocks, even in a bad market.
This capital was following earning improvements as a dog follows a
scent. This discovery opened my eyes to a completely new
perspective.
I saw that it is true that stocks are the slaves of earning power.
Consequently, I decided that while there may be many reasons behind
any stock movement, I would look only for one: improving earning
power or anticipation of it. To do that, I would marry my technical
approach to the fundamental one. I would select stocks on their
technical action in the market, but I would only buy them when I
could give improving earning power as my fundamental reason for
doing so.
This was how I arrived at my techno-fundamentalist theory, which I
am still using today.
As to the practical application, I decided to take a 20-year view. That
did not mean I wanted to hold a stock for 20 years. Nothing was more
contrary to my intentions. But I looked out for those stocks, which
were tied up with the future and where I could expect that
revolutionary new products would sharply improve the company's
earnings.


As I flew around the world, I was constantly searching for stocks that
would climb into the stratosphere because of the vision of their
future. This attitude was a preparation for what I suppose you could
call high-territory trading. I looked for stocks that I thought could
make new highs and I decided to give them my full attention when
they had climbed on to the launching pad and were preparing to
rocket up. Now these stocks would be more expensive than ever
before and so they would look too dear to the uninitiated. But they
could become dearer. I made up my mind to buy high and sell higher.


I closely observed their price action, and I was on the alert for any
unusual activity as well. I had not forgotten the importance of volume.


I did suspect one thing, however—and that was that the leaders in
the previous market would probably not lead again. I felt sure they
had fulfilled their place in history and they would not—for the time
being—reach the same dizzy heights that had brought so much money
to the investors who had followed them.


I did not know then that they were the manufacturers of a particular
brand of filter-tip cigarettes and the filter-tip craze was about to sweep
America, causing their production to leap up astronomically. Out in
Saigon, all I knew was that LORILLARD began to emerge from the swamp
of sinking stocks like a beacon. In spite of the bad market, it rose from
17 until, in the first week of October; it established itself in the
narrow box 24/27 . Its volume for that week was 126,700 shares,
which sharply contrasted with its usual 10,000 shares earlier in the year.


I felt I
had the right stock. Now it was a question of getting into it with more
money at the right time.


I also wavered for a moment, on the verge of selling, but I decided
against it. By now I had trained myself to be patient and, although I
could have taken an easy $20 per share profit on my earliest purchase,
I sat back determined not to take too quick a profit.


The
stock seemed to have lost its will to rise. It looked as though its last
pyramid would hesitate on the brink of going into reverse. It almost
seemed ready to tumble. So as not to get caught in any collapse, I
decided to raise my stop-loss to the unusually narrow margin of 36⅜.


What amazed me was the movement of E. L. BRUCE on Street. It usually
traded below 5,000 shares a week. Then it suddenly woke up and started
to move. In the second week of April 1958, its volume rose to an
astonishing 19,100 shares. Thereafter the weekly volume climbed to
41,500—54,200—76,500 shares, with the price jumping 5 to 8 points
weekly without any sign of downward reaction.


It was obvious even in faraway India that something fantastic was
happening on the American Stock Exchange. I had to fight a hard
battle with myself not to phone New York and find out what was
going on. No, I said to myself as I felt like calling my brokers, that
will only mean rumors and you may do something silly.


I had made over $325,000 in nine months' investment,
and I was determined not to lose it by a wrong move. So many
operators have made big money in nine months and lost it in nine
weeks. I decided this would not happen to me. The first step I took was
to withdraw half of my profits from the market.
As so often after a coup, I had very little success for a
month or two immediately afterwards


His argument was: What was the point of buying a stock if it
might go down? He reckoned you should only buy stock that was sure
to rise—as if anyone could be sure.


Finally, I decided not to sell. It was the best example of my new
market technique and it was anything but easy to do. By the time I
arrived back at my hotel I was exhausted. I must have looked more
like a man about to commit suicide than one who had just made himself
a small fortune.
But I was proved right, THIOKOL continued to rise and by making that
decision in Paris, I was able to hold on and make much more money
out of the stock.


The truth was that as my pocket had strengthened, my head had
weakened. I became over-confident, and that is the most dangerous state
of mind anyone can develop in the stock market. It was not long before I
received the bitter lesson the market always hands out to those who
think they can carelessly master it.


I was fascinated by my first visit to the office. The boardroom was
large, with chairs placed in front of an ever-moving little machine, the
stock-ticker. The atmosphere was exciting, filled with electricity. The
people in the room, like hangers-on in Monte Carlo, were nervous,
exalted. There was an air of action, bustle, and noise. Tickers ticking,
typewriters pounding, telegraph machines clacking, clerks busily rushing
around. From every direction I heard sentences like: "GOODYEAR doesn't
look good to me." "I am getting out of ANACONDA." "The market is
ripe for a reaction."
The first day I was quite unperturbed by this taut, electric atmosphere.
With my success behind me I felt I was above the anxieties, hopes and
fears of these tense people. But this did not last long. As I began
trading day to day from the boardroom, I gradually abandoned my
detachment and started to join them. I opened my ears to the
confusing combination of facts, opinions and gossip. I read the
market letters. I also started to answer questions like, "What do you
think of the market?" or "What do you know that's cheap?" All this
had a deadly effect on me.
In a few days of trading, I threw overboard everything I had learned
over the past six years. I did everything I had trained myself not to
do. I talked to brokers. I listened to rumors. I was never off the
ticker.
It was as if the "get-rich-quick" demon had gotten hold of me. I
completely lost the clear perspective I had so carefully built up
through my cables. Step by step I led myself along a path where I
began to lose my skill.
The first thing that deserted me was my sixth sense. I did not "feel"
anything. All I could see was a jungle of stocks running up and down
without rhyme or reason. Then my independence went. I gradually
abandoned my system and adopted the attitude of the others. The first
thing I knew, I was following the crowd. My reason forsook me and
emotion took over completely.
It is easier to understand how difficult it was for me to cling to my
system if I explain it this way: Yell "fire" in a crowded theatre and what
happens? People rush for the exit, killing, injuring each other. A
drowning man will struggle, grasp his would-be rescuer and perhaps
pull him under too. They are unreasonable, wrong attitudes, yet instinct
will dictate them.
As I followed the crowd I also started to act like this. Instead of being a
lone wolf, I became a confused, excited lamb milling around with
others, waiting to be clipped. It was impossible for me to say "no"
when everybody around me was saying "yes". I got scared when they
got scared. I became hopeful when they were hopeful.
Nothing like this, not even in my first novice years, had ever happened
to me. I lost all my skill and control. Everything I touched went
wrong.
I behaved like a complete amateur. The careful system I had built up
collapsed around me. Every transaction ended in disaster. I put in
dozens of contradictory orders. I bought stocks at 55. They went back to
51. I hung on. Stop-loss? That was the first thing I threw away.
Patience? Judgment? I had none. Boxes? I forgot about them.
As the days went by the vicious circle of my operations started to
look like this:
I BOUGHT AT THE TOP As
   Soon as I bought
      The stock started to drop I
         Became frightened
            AND SOLD AT THE BOTTOM
               As soon as I sold
                  The stock started to rise I became greedy
                     AND BOUGHT AT THE TOP
It was a period of complete disaster. I lost $100,000 in a few weeks. A
detailed list of my trading at this time reads like a lunatic's chronicle.
I can still hardly believe it. Now I know that it was caused by egotism
leading to vanity leading to over-confidence, which in turn led to
disaster. It was not the market that beat me. It was my own unreasoning
instincts and uncontrolled emotions.


The plain fact was that I was reading too much, trying to do too much.
That is why I rapidly reached the stage where I could read the
figures on the stock market quotations but they no longer told me
anything. Not long afterwards came an even worse phase. Haunted by
never-ending losses, terrified by the confusion, racked by rumors, I got
so I could not even see the figures. My coordination broke down. I used
to pore all day over columns of figures, which my eyes scanned, but I
could not assimilate. My mind had become blurred. This last phase really
frightened me. I felt like a drunk who loses touch with reality and
cannot understand why.
At the end of a few disastrous weeks, I sat down soberly to examine the
reasons why this should have happened to me. Why should I have the
touch in Hong Kong, Calcutta, Saigon and Stockholm, and lose it when
I was within half a mile of Wall Street? What was the difference?
There was no easy solution to the problem and for a long time I was
baffled. Then one day, as I sat in the Plaza Hotel afraid to make a
telephone call, I suddenly realized something. When I was abroad, I
visited no boardrooms, talked to no one, received no telephone calls,
watched no ticker.
The solution was whispering to me but at first I could not credit it. It
was so surprising, so simple and yet so extraordinary that I could hardly
believe it. It was: My ears were my enemy.
It dawned on me like a revelation that when I was traveling abroad I had
been able to assess the market, or rather the few stocks in which I was
interested, calmly, neutrally, without interruption or rumor, completely
without emotion and ego.


This is how I worked it out. I asked my brokers to send out their
telegrams after Wall Street closing time, so they would reach me at 6
P.M. This is about the time I get up—the result of performing in
nightclubs for many years. Meanwhile, during the day, the telephone
operator is instructed not to let any calls through.
In this way everything happens in Wall Street while I am in bed. I am
sleeping while they are working, and they cannot reach me nor worry
me. My delegate, the stop-loss order, represents me in case something
unforeseen happens.
At 7 P.M. I start to work studying my daily telegram and deciding
what my future dealings will be. Before I do this, I buy a copy of an
afternoon paper that contains Wall Street closing prices. I tear out the
pages giving the day's quotations and throw the rest of the financial
section away. I do not wish to read any financial stories or
commentaries, however well informed. They might lead me astray.
Then, with my telegram and my page out of the newspaper, I settle
down to work while Wall Street sleeps.


You will notice that in
each case I was successful in taking larger profits than losses in proportion to
the amounts invested


Of course, it could not last. The governors of the New York Stock
Exchange decided to suspend all stop orders. The effect of this was that
the majority of traders left the stock alone. They would not buy and sell
a stock where they could not protect themselves. It also meant that I
was automatically out of the stock myself. They had taken my most
powerful tool away, and I could not work without it.


On each of these stocks I put a stop-loss order of 10 per cent below
buying price.
I was fully aware that these stop-losses were vague and too mechanical.
It was a deliberate, if clumsy, method. I purposely used this system
because I knew sooner or later it would eliminate those of the four that
were weakest.


It was the fourth week of May when I proceeded to switch more than
$1,000,000 into the two stronger stocks. These were my total
purchases:

ZENITH RADIO
500 shares at        104      $ 52,247.00
1,500 shares at      99¾      150,359.70
1,000 shares at      104      104,494.00
1,000 shares at      105¼     105,745.30
1,500 shares at      107½     161,996.25
----------------------------------------
Total 5,500 shares           $574,842.25

FAIRCHILD CAMERA
500 shares at        128      $64,259.00
1,000 shares at      123¼     123,763.30
1,000 shares at      125      125,515.00
1,000 shares at      126¼     126,766.30
1,000 shares at      127      127,517.00
----------------------------------------
Total 4,500 shares            $567,820.60


I was also faced with the same dilemma I had known before: Should I
sell? Should I get out altogether?
The answer this time was easy. It was the old tried and trusted answer: I
did not have any reason to sell a rising stock. I would just continue to
jog along with the trend, trailing my stop-loss behind me. As the trend
increased, I would buy more. If the trend reversed? I would, as ever,
flee like a disturbed burglar.
I put new stop-losses on all my stocks so that if they dropped while I
was on my way to Europe I would be sold out and my two million
would remain intact.
I felt content and assured as I rode up Fifth Avenue in a taxi after
leaving my brokers.
I walked into the lobby of the Plaza Hotel, automatically bought an
evening paper, tore out the Wall Street closing prices, threw the rest of
the newspaper away, picked up my 6 P.M. telegram and went up in the
elevator.
In my room I opened the telegram, spread out the sheet of newspaper,
and sat back with a happy sigh. Not only because I had made two
million dollars but because I was doing what I liked best.
I was working while Wall Street slept.



Further Investigation: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
June 15, 2016 - I've got a working program that analyzes volume spikes, 52 week high, and an overall
analysis of whether the stock is in a bull or bear state. It has been interesting to see the
results, however, I decided to gather more information about how the method should be implimented.
It is easy to see where the method would have been successful in hindsight, but the trick is
knowing when to get in and when to get out. The following exerpts are some extracts about
the Darvas mehod:


www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/darvas.asp ------------------------------------------------
-Fundamental Screen: Industries of tomorrow

-The box is created when the stock trades within a rectangle formation. This is characterized by
 prices trading within a narrow range for at least three weeks. To quantify the box, traders should
 look for stocks in which the difference between the high and the low price over the past four weeks
 is less than 10% of the stock's high during that time. As a formula, it can be written as:
 (100 * ((High – Low) / High)) < 10

-The buy should be taken at the market's open the morning after the stock closes outside the box by
 at least half a point on a volume that is greater than the average 30-day volume. The initial stop
 should be set a quarter point below the lowest price of the box. It should be raised as new boxes
 form, always a quarter point below the low.


www.darvastrader.com/2012/09/13/the-classic-book-by-nicolas-darvas-finally-gets-revised-and-updated/
-...one of the big mistakes traders make today in trying to apply the Darvas System is being too
 focused on the specifics of his famous “Darvas Boxes.”  The real key has always been the
 recognition of valid support and resistance levels.  “Darvas Boxes” help with this recognition,
 but there are several other ways – often more appropriate ways – to evaluate these levels.  For
 example, other proven chart patterns, significant moving averages, etc.

-...do not focus on the money you can make, focus on the money you could lose.  ALWAYS control your
 positions sizes and cut your losses at your predetermined stop. If the support level fails, get
 out.


www.swing-trade-stocks.com/trading-methods-darvas-trading.html -------------------------------------
-For a stock to qualify as a potential Darvas trade, it first has to exhibit a proof of changed
 behavior in the form of a recent volume change of at least a 400% increase compared to the average
 daily volume for the past few weeks. The stock must also be rising in price and make a new yearly
 high. The Darvas Box upper and lower boundaries will then form if this high is not touched or
 penetrated for the next 3 consecutive trading days followed by a retracement low that’s not touched
 or penetrated for a further 3 days in a row, as shown in the picture above. Darvas tells us that
 sometimes the top and bottom of the box may form on the same day. In such a case, the requirement
 is that neither the high nor the low of that day are touched or penetrated for 3 consecutive trading
 days.

-Once a box forms, a buy stop order is placed to purchase the stock the moment it pushes through the
 top of the box. At the same time, an automatic stop loss order is entered just below the bottom of
 the box to protect the position.

-Do not be afraid of getting stopped out! Many times, Darvas would be stopped out for the sake of a
 point just to see the stock climb up immediately after. But he realized that this was not as
 important as protecting his position and profits! If sold out, consider buying the stock back on
 the break of a fresh new high.


http://www.boxcharts.com/darvas-box-theory-explained-1.html ---------------------------------------
-The Darvas box theory is a momentum strategy for use with a short-term trading style. When I saw
 short-term, I don't mean day trade, although I suppose that is possible as well. I mean short-term
 in the sense that one tends to hold the stock for less than a year. However, the exit points are
 not very well defined by Darvas. His only remark is that he sells when the stock penetrates the
 box to the downside.

-According to Darvas, it all boiled down to one thing: "improving earnings power or anticipationg
 of it". That's about as fundamental as Darvas gets in his book.

-To identify a Darvas box, one would first locate the highest price that a stock reached during a
 certain period. Then, if that price is not breached to the upside for three days, Darvas would
 consider it to be the top of the box. It is only after locating the top of the box that one begins
 to search for the bottom. Darvas was adament about this point. Locating the bottom of the box is
 essentially the same as looking for the top, but in reverse. Once the box has been defined, says
 Darvas, the stock should bounce around in it. If it does not, he would be worried. If, at some
 point in the future, the stock pierces the top of the established box ('by a tick' says Darvas),
 then one would immediately buy the stock.
