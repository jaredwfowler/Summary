ABOUT **********************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Stand Alone, tifyBox 3D Module. Requires canvas parent ID to be passed in. The parent canvas MUST
be a max w/h of 1400px.

Dependency: jQuery

Translation: Shift+MouseDown+MouseMove || Two Finger Swipe
 Translation is very accurate b/c the object is analyzed in model space. Every time the user
 re-adjusts the zoom factor, new values are found which determine the movement ratio from screen
 movement to model view movement.
Rotation: MouseDown+MouseMove || One Finger Swipe
 Also uses the ratio factor which translate uses to get an appropriate rotation amount. This
 effectively "slows down" the rotation as the user zooms in closer to tifyBox.
Selection: Click || Touch
 Selection is done via my own version of picking. We are fragment picking, not vertex triangle
 picking. The coords of click are given to the fragment shader. Intersection with these coords is
 tested for, and the results are written to a separate frame buffer texture. The texture is then
 analyzed to determine the u,v texture coordinates which were encoded into a RGBA value in the FS,
 which is then used to represent the face, X, and Y.
Touch Events
 This was a challenge by itself due to random anomalies in sensitive screens. When you put your
 finger down you are literally registering several touches, b/c of blood in the finger I denoted.
 This has been taken into account and the touch events seem to work wonderfully!
Transform to a given F,X,Y
 The transform is calculated out to find the needed rotation angle and distance. The work is then
 subdivided up to occur within several draw events.

CHANGE LOG *****************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************
Oct. 12, 2015 - Jared Fowler
Changed the order of the faces to match tify. Updated commentaries in code. Deleted interval to take
exposure sample. It is now controlled by function call, which makes the overall experience a tad
better! Changed the fragment texture to have a width and height of 1400. This will require that the
canvas be limited to these dimensions!

Oct. 13, 2015 - Jared Fowler
Modified code to not submit user clicks to new window. Instead, the class will simply update the
selection info and rely on the parent container to check for updated selections. A mutex check was
added for click events.

Nov. 21, 2016 - Jared Fowler
Removed several checks which had to do with unused alpha. Tifybox has a new architecture where every
square should be filled and have a valid URL.

Jan. 31, 2017 - Jared Fowler
Tifybox has become a pure YouTube interface. All blocks are not guaranteed to be filled, hence,
going back to older architecture.
