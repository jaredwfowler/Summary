I've done web design projects for clients and for personal use.
This sample contains code snippets from a client website. It used
the Laravel framework, PHP in the backend and JavaScript on the 
front. To better allow the client to update the website, I created
a script which unpacks a JSON file which contains instructions to
build a website. This allows the client to potentially add new 
content to their website, (not just adding pictures, but adding 
entirely new containers to a web page), without the need for 
developer help. The website generated from this JSON script can
be seen in the sample website link below.

Sample Website:

The PHP files show the extent of page building done on the server
side. (Very minimum and very generic.) Most of the page building
is done real-time on the client side.
