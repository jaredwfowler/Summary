NEW BUGS

.....FML....
no persistent data after application fully closes or phone restarts. either data not saving or boolean checks not works
    switch storage to sdcard not internal memory.

FIXED!!!
purchasing rewards, wont let u purchase some, like gold and the first one, changes price after purchase.
    check load method in menu and purchase method in reward activity

FIXED!!!
miss-match achievement and rewards display bug is caused by getting the achievement from lib based on index position of achievement in listview.
    once some are earned the index's aren't a one to on match anymore. so if lower achievement is in position 3, it will display 3rd achievement in lib array
