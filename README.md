# Summary
A selection of files taken from my repositories for the purpose of showcasing my Software Engineering characteristics.

   I believe that programming is the perfect combination between logic and creativity.  The way which the code is written is 
a form of art, which is a direct representation of the coders characteristics. I like my code to have the following requirements:
   -Neat
   -Modular
   -Robust
   -Documented
   -Simple
   -Efficient
   -Secure
   
There are several more examples of my work which are available for viewing in the individual repositories. https://github.com/jaredwfowler
