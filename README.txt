LATEST STYLE:

My coding style is continually evolving, and most of the examples in this summary are from years 
ago. The links below showcase my current preferences for style, naming conventions, and other 
coding practices.

C++ was the first language I learned, and it will always hold a special place for me. However, my 
favorite language is C due to its efficiency and level of developer control. My C development style 
emphasizes encapsulation while avoiding the overhead, bloat, and debugging challenges of inheritance 
and polymorphism by leveraging function pointers.

I, of course, firmly believe that the #1 rule when working on an existing codebase is to follow its 
established style and methodology. For example, while I prefer spaces for indentation, I will use 
tabs if that is the expected or existing convention.
